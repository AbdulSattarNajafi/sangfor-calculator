          Security & Networking Org Efficiency Gain: IT Teams spend a
          considerable amount of time and effort on managing software updates,
          patching servers, resolving mundane support tickets, and administering
          a siloed policy infrastructure, which prevents them from tackling a
          variety of strategic projects. Existing Access Secure customers were
          able to reduce their administrative overhead and benefitted from
          simplified networking and security administration, automated updates,
          centralized monitoring, and proactive threat prevention.

          Security & Networking Infra Cost Reduction: With Sangfor Access
          Secure, customers have significantly reduced their annual security and
          networking tech spend by replacing expensive hardware appliances such
          as VPNs, SWGs, FWs, Edge Security, DLP, SD-WAN, Web Proxy and MPLS
          connections. The unified Access secure platform eliminates vendor
          management expenses, upfront hardware expenditures, licensing fees,
          and ongoing maintenance costs of physical infrastructure.
