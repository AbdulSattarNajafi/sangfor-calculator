            Security & Networking Org Efficiency Gain: IT Teams spend a
            considerable amount of time and effort on managing software updates,
            patching servers, resolving mundane support tickets, and
            administering a siloed policy infrastructure, which prevents them
            from tackling a variety of strategic projects. Existing Access
            Secure customers were able to reduce their administrative overhead
            and benefitted from simplified networking and security

            Additional administrative overhead savings are unlocked by Access

            Security & Networking Infra Cost Reduction: With Sangfor Access

            such as VPNs, SWGs, FWs, Edge Security, DLP, SD-WAN, Web Proxy and
            MPLS connections. The unified Access secure platform eliminates
